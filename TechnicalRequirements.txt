The goal is to create a list of tests for a Python tool to evaluate your OCSP server product, ensuring it correctly addresses known issues and adheres to relevant standards like RFC 6960 (OCSP) and RFC 4806 (OCSP Extensions to IKEv2).
The tests are categorized below based on critical areas of OCSP server functionality: Protocol Compliance, Certificate Status Handling, Error and Security Handling, and Performance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
List of Tests for OCSP Server Product Evaluation
I. Protocol Compliance and Message Format
These tests ensure the server correctly implements the basic OCSP message structure and transport formats as defined primarily by RFC 6960.
1. Request Transport Testing (HTTP Methods):
    ◦ Test sending a well-formed OCSP request using HTTP GET (typically for small requests, less than 255 bytes after encoding).
    ◦ Test sending a well-formed OCSP request using HTTP POST (typically for larger requests or when caching is not prioritized).
2. Request/Response Encoding Validation:
    ◦ Verify that the server correctly accepts and processes requests encoded using the DER encoding rules specified in ASN.1.
    ◦ Verify that the server consistently outputs responses using the correct DER encoding.
3. Basic Response Structure Checks:
    ◦ Verify that a successful response includes the basic elements: version, responderID, producedAt time, certificate responses, signature algorithm OID, and digital signature computed over a hash of the response data.
    ◦ Verify the reported protocol version is correct (e.g., v1(0)).
4. Certificate Identifier (CertID) Verification:
    ◦ Test requests where the CertID fields (hashAlgorithm, issuerNameHash, issuerKeyHash, serialNumber) are correctly formatted according to the certificate being checked.
    ◦ Verify the server correctly uses SHA-1 hashing when identifying the issuer's name and public key hash, even if later algorithms are used for the signature.
II. Certificate Status and Validity Logic
These tests confirm that the server correctly processes certificate identification and returns the accurate status based on revocation lists (CRLs) or internal data.
1. Valid Certificate Status:
    ◦ Send a request for a known valid and non-revoked certificate and confirm the server returns the SUCCESSFUL response status and a certificate status of good.
2. Revoked Certificate Status:
    ◦ Send a request for a known revoked certificate and confirm the server returns the SUCCESSFUL response status and a certificate status of revoked.
    ◦ For a revoked response, verify that the RevokedInfo structure contains the accurate revocationTime and, if provided, the revocationReason.
3. Unknown/Unrecognized Certificate Status:
    ◦ Send a request for a certificate issued by an unrecognized CA and verify the response status is typically unknown (indicating the responder does not serve that issuer).
4. Handling Non-Issued Certificates:
    ◦ Test the server's response for a certificate serial number it has no record of issuing (a "non-issued" certificate).
    ◦ If the server supports the extended definition of the revoked status for non-issued certificates, confirm it returns the revoked status with the extended-revoked extension, the reason code certificateHold (6), and a revocation time of January 1, 1970.
5. Response Timeliness Validation:
    ◦ Verify that the response accurately sets the thisUpdate field (the most recent time status was known to be correct) and the producedAt field (the time the response was signed).
    ◦ Verify the nextUpdate field (time at or before which newer information will be available) is set correctly, respecting maximum validity periods configured by policy.
III. Error and Security Handling
These tests focus on security measures, handling invalid inputs, and adhering to cryptographic trust requirements.
1. Handling Malformed Requests (Protocol Errors):
    ◦ Send requests that violate the basic OCSP syntax to ensure the server correctly rejects them with the malformedRequest (1) error code.
    ◦ Test inputs that deliberately violate constraints of specific extensions (e.g., setting the Nonce length to 0 or exceeding 128 octets) to ensure rejection with malformedRequest.
2. Handling Operational Errors:
    ◦ Simulate internal service failures or unavailability to test if the server correctly returns internalError (2) or tryLater (3).
3. Authentication and Authorization Errors:
    ◦ Test responses when the client is not authorized to query the specific certificate status, expecting the unauthorized (6) error.
    ◦ Test responses when a signed request is mandatory but missing, expecting the sigRequired (5) error.
4. Replay Attack Prevention (Nonce Extension):
    ◦ Test enabling and including the Nonce extension (id-pkix-ocsp-nonce) in requests.
    ◦ Verify that the server includes the matching Nonce value in the response to cryptographically bind the message pair, preventing replay attacks.
    ◦ Verify the server correctly handles required Nonce lengths (minimum 32 octets for requesters implementing RFC 9654).
    ◦ If the server utilizes pre-produced responses, confirm the server logic to use a short validity interval (thisUpdate to nextUpdate) as a mitigation for potential Nonce absence/replay.
5. Signature Trust Validation:
    ◦ Verify that the signature on the response is valid using the issuing CA’s public key.
    ◦ If the server uses Delegated Responders, verify that the responder certificate possesses the id-kp-OCSPSigning Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension.
    ◦ If clients specify preferred signature algorithms, verify the server attempts to select a supported algorithm from the client's preference list.
IV. Performance, Scalability, and Operational Checks
These tests focus on ensuring the OCSP server is reliable and scalable in a production environment.
1. Availability and Latency Monitoring:
    ◦ Continuously monitor OCSP service availability and regularly measure end-to-end response times (latency), establishing a baseline for performance under typical load (aiming for low latency, possibly around a median of 20 ms, which is a recent benchmark).
    ◦ Test performance impacts when validating certificates over geographically distributed networks (if applicable to the solution infrastructure).
2. Load Testing and DoS Mitigation:
    ◦ Conduct stress testing to determine the maximum request throughput and identify potential bottlenecks (e.g., related to processing power or HSM limitations for signing).
    ◦ Simulate high-volume query floods to validate implemented rate limiting or network security measures intended to mitigate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
3. Caching Mechanism Verification:
    ◦ If the server employs response caching, verify that cached responses are served efficiently without compromising freshness (i.e., adhering to nextUpdate before serving a new status).
    ◦ Check cache expiration logic against configured settings.
V. IKEv2 Integration (RFC 4806)
Since you are building a product intended for customers who may utilize IPsec/IKEv2, these tests verify compliance with RFC 4806 for "in-band" OCSP delivery.
1. OCSP Content Extension Support:
    ◦ Verify the server correctly uses and processes the "OCSP Content" extension (encoding type 14) within CERTREQ payloads (as a request for an OCSP response) and CERT payloads (as the container for the OCSP response).
2. Request for OCSP Response:
    ◦ Test generating an IKEv2 CERTREQ payload with encoding type 14 and verify the server accurately responds by including the appropriate OCSP response inside a CERT payload in the reply.
3. Trusted Responder Identification:
    ◦ Test handling a CERTREQ payload that specifically identifies known OCSP responder certificates (ocsp_signers) or trusted Certificate Authority (CA) hashes, verifying the server selects the correct signing authority based on configuration.
4. Configuration Testing:
    ◦ Ensure the server configuration correctly maps connection policy variables (e.g., allowing "request," "reply," or "both" OCSP behaviors in IKEv2 communication).
