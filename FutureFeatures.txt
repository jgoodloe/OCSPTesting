-serial num

Same as the -cert option except the certificate with serial number num is added to the request. The serial number is interpreted as a decimal integer unless preceded by 0x. Negative integers can also be specified by preceding the value by a - sign.


Nonces don't appear to be working or the test is incorrect
Also add nonces to the initial ocsp test
-nonce, -no_nonce

Add an OCSP nonce extension to a request or disable OCSP nonce addition. Normally if an OCSP request is input using the -reqin option no nonce is added: using the -nonce option will force addition of a nonce. If an OCSP request is being created (using -cert and -serial options) a nonce is automatically added specifying -no_nonce overrides this.





-trust_other

The certificates specified by the -verify_other option should be explicitly trusted and no additional checks will be performed on them. This is useful when the complete responder certificate chain is not available or trusting a root CA is not appropriate.



-VAfile file

File or URI containing explicitly trusted responder certificates. Equivalent to the -verify_other and -trust_other options. The input can be in PEM, DER, or PKCS#12 format.


Not sure if these should be there
-no_chain

Do not use certificates in the response as additional untrusted CA certificates.

-no_explicit

Do not explicitly trust the root CA if it is set to be trusted for OCSP signing.
