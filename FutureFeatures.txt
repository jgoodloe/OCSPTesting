The project https://github.com/jgoodloe/OCSPTesting implements a basic OCSP client using Java, BouncyCastle, and OkHttp, focusing on generating a request, sending it via HTTP GET, and checking if the response status is SUCCESSFUL. Based on the provided context, the primary functionality exists within the ocspValidate and parseOcspResponse methods, with the current implementation showing success for a valid certificate and failure (UNAUTHORIZED) for a request sent to the wrong endpoint.
However, to align with robust cryptographic and internet standards (RFC 6960, RFC 4806, RFC 9654), the following critical tests and features appear to be missing or inadequately implemented:
I. Core OCSP Response Validation and Security Checks
The client's current parseOcspResponse method is insufficient as it only checks the top-level status (OCSPResp.SUCCESSFUL). Comprehensive validation requires deep inspection of the response content and security features.
A. Integrity and Trust Verification Tests
1. Response Signature Verification: The current Java logic does not explicitly perform cryptographic verification of the digital signature on the OCSP response. The client SHALL confirm that the signature is valid using the appropriate public key (e.g., the CA's key).
2. Delegated Responder Authorization Check: The client is missing tests to confirm that if the response is signed by an entity other than the issuing CA (a Designated/Authorized Responder), the signer's certificate contains the mandatory id-kp-OCSPSigning Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension. Clients MUST recognize delegation only if the responder certificate was signed by the same key used to sign the certificate being checked.
3. Certificate Status Interpretation: Beyond checking for SUCCESSFUL status, tests are required to check the actual certificate status (CertStatus) contained within the response, which must be explicitly interpreted as good, revoked, or unknown.
4. Response Validity Period Check: The system must validate the response freshness by checking the thisUpdate (most recent time status was correct) and nextUpdate (time before which newer information will be available) fields. Responses where nextUpdate is earlier than local time SHOULD be considered unreliable.
B. Anti-Replay and Cryptographic Tests
1. Nonce Response Verification: Although the client implements logic to include a Nonce extension in the request, there are no tests described to verify that the matching Nonce value is returned within the response. Failure to perform this check allows replay attacks using old, valid OCSP responses.
2. Nonce Length Compliance: The implementation uses a 16-byte nonce. Modern OCSP requester implementations MUST use a minimum length of 32 octets for the Nonce extension, and clients should support lengths up to 128 octets. The project should include tests for handling different compliant nonce lengths.
3. Cryptographic Algorithm Negotiation: The implementation lacks support for indicating cryptographic preferences. Tests should be added for including the optional Preferred Signature Algorithms extension (id-pkix-ocsp-pref-sig-algs) in the request to mitigate Man-in-the-Middle downgrade attacks on the signature algorithm used by the responder.
II. Error Handling and Edge Case Compliance Testing
The project currently only demonstrates successful (SUCCESSFUL) and endpoint-related error (UNAUTHORIZED) responses. Robust testing requires handling all defined protocol error states and specialized revocation scenarios.
1. Malformed Request Handling: Tests should deliberately send syntactically invalid OCSP requests to confirm the server returns the malformedRequest (1) error status. This guards against improper encoding or malicious attempts to violate protocol syntax.
2. Server Operational Errors: The system needs tests to correctly process internalError (2) and tryLater (3) responses, indicating temporary server failure or load issues.
3. Signed Request Requirement: If future use requires it, tests should verify handling of the sigRequired (5) error status, indicating the server mandates a digitally signed request.
4. Testing Non-Issued Certificates: The implemented logic must be tested against a certificate serial number the CA has never issued. If the server utilizes the Extended Revoked Definition, the client must correctly identify the revoked status, accompanied by the extended-revoked extension, certificateHold (6) revocation reason, and a revocationTime of January 1, 1970.
III. Missing Protocol Functionality
The current implementation is limited to HTTP GET and manual processing of a single certificate status.
1. HTTP POST Support: The method callOcspEndpoint exclusively uses HTTP GET. The implementation is missing support and tests for sending requests via HTTP POST, which is necessary for complex or large requests (over 255 bytes after encoding).
2. Multiple Certificate Status (OCSP Multi-Stapling): The project only requests status for a single certificate. It lacks support and testing for the Multiple Certificate Status Request extension (RFC 6961), which allows a client to request status information for an entire certificate chain (intermediate certificates) during the handshake.
3. OCSP for IKEv2 Integration (RFC 4806): Given that OCSP is heavily referenced within the IPsec/IKEv2 standards domain, the project is missing tests for using the "OCSP Content" extension (encoding type 14) defined in RFC 4806. This specialized mode facilitates in-band OCSP request and response transmission within IKEv2 CERTREQ and CERT payloads, especially when network security policies (like firewalls) prevent direct access to OCSP responders. This would involve supporting configuration options like never, request, reply, and both for OCSP behavior in IKEv2 connections.









The project described in the excerpts (https://github.com/jgoodloe/OCSPTesting) focuses on a "manual" client-side OCSP validation implemented in Java using BouncyCastle and OkHttp. While the current implementation covers the basic steps of generating a request, sending it via HTTP GET, and checking the top-level response status, several critical tests, adherence to standard practices, and advanced security considerations appear to be missing or unimplemented based on comprehensive OCSP and PKI standards documentation:
I. Comprehensive OCSP Validation Logic and Compliance
The primary functionality gap lies in the depth of response validation within the parseOcspResponse method, which currently only checks if the response status is SUCCESSFUL.
1. Response Signature Verification: The Java code does not implement full verification of the digital signature on the OCSP response. A fundamental step for accepting an OCSP response as valid is confirming that the signature is valid using the issuing Certificate Authority’s (CA) public key. The lack of this verification leaves the system vulnerable to attackers forging responses.
2. Handling Delegated Responders: The implementation likely assumes the response is signed directly by the issuing CA's certificate. It is missing logic to handle responses signed by a CA Designated Responder (or Authorized Responder), which requires confirming that the responder's certificate includes the id-kp-OCSPSigning Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension, as defined in RFC 6960.
3. Certificate Status Detail Parsing: The current code only determines if the top-level response status is SUCCESSFUL. It misses crucial checks on the actual certificate status contained within the response data, specifically the CertStatus value, which indicates good, revoked, or unknown. The system needs logic to ensure the certificate status is explicitly good, or to process the revocation details (revocationTime and revocationReason) if the status is revoked.
4. Testing Non-Issued Certificates: The existing tests show failure when querying the wrong endpoint (UNAUTHORIZED). A necessary test involves requesting the status for a certificate serial number that was never issued by the CA. A compliant OCSP server should return the revoked state, along with the specific Extended Revoked Definition extension and the certificateHold revocation reason. The current system does not check for these specific standards.
5. Response Validity Interval Checks: The parsing logic does not check the response validity interval defined by the thisUpdate and nextUpdate fields. Clients must check that the reported status time (thisUpdate) is sufficiently recent and that the nextUpdate time has not passed.
II. Security and Attack Mitigation Testing
1. Replay Attack Defense Verification (Nonce Check): Although the functionality to include the Nonce extension in the request is present, the current response parsing logic does not mention verifying that the identical nonce is included in the response. Failure to verify the Nonce in the response allows an attacker to intercept and replay an old "good" response, even if the certificate has since been revoked. Testing must confirm that if a Nonce is sent, a response lacking the correct Nonce (or the Nonce extension entirely) is rejected, especially if the response is pre-produced/cached.
2. Handling Cryptographic Downgrade Attacks: The current client logic does not implement mechanisms for negotiating cryptographic preferences with the server. It lacks support for including the Preferred Signature Algorithms extension in the OCSP request, which allows the client to indicate supported algorithms and helps prevent potential Man-in-the-Middle downgrade attacks on the signature algorithm used by the responder.
3. Support for Other OCSP Extensions: The current implementation only supports the optional Nonce extension. It lacks support or testing for other standard OCSP extensions defined in RFC 6960, such as CRL References (to reference the CRL where status info is found) or the Service Locator (used by responders to route requests to the authoritative server).
III. Missing OCSP Methodologies (Client Perspective)
1. HTTP POST Support: The current system exclusively uses HTTP GET for requests. It lacks testing and implementation support for sending the OCSP request using HTTP POST. POST is typically required for larger requests (over 255 bytes after encoding) or when clients do not want to rely on caching infrastructure.
2. OCSP Stapling/Multi-Stapling Integration: Since the project is an OCSP client implementation, it focuses on direct queries to the OCSP responder. It lacks the logic necessary to participate in advanced revocation mechanisms like:
    ◦ OCSP Stapling (TLS Certificate Status Request extension).
    ◦ OCSP Multi-Stapling (RFC 6961), which allows fetching status for an entire certificate chain (including intermediate CAs) within the TLS handshake. This extension supports two modes (ocsp and ocsp_multi).
3. IKEv2 Integration (RFC 4806): While the source code is a generalized Java utility, if the project is intended for use within an IPsec/IKEv2 ecosystem (as referenced by related RFCs in the sources), the core capability of sending and receiving OCSP data in-band within the IKEv2 protocol messages is missing. This specialized functionality requires supporting the use of the "OCSP Content" extension (encoding type 14) within CERTREQ and CERT payloads.

https://docs.openssl.org/3.0/man1/openssl-ocsp/#ocsp-client-options
-serial num

Same as the -cert option except the certificate with serial number num is added to the request. The serial number is interpreted as a decimal integer unless preceded by 0x. Negative integers can also be specified by preceding the value by a - sign.


Nonces don't appear to be working or the test is incorrect
Also add nonces to the initial ocsp test
-nonce, -no_nonce

Add an OCSP nonce extension to a request or disable OCSP nonce addition. Normally if an OCSP request is input using the -reqin option no nonce is added: using the -nonce option will force addition of a nonce. If an OCSP request is being created (using -cert and -serial options) a nonce is automatically added specifying -no_nonce overrides this.





-trust_other

The certificates specified by the -verify_other option should be explicitly trusted and no additional checks will be performed on them. This is useful when the complete responder certificate chain is not available or trusting a root CA is not appropriate.



-VAfile file

File or URI containing explicitly trusted responder certificates. Equivalent to the -verify_other and -trust_other options. The input can be in PEM, DER, or PKCS#12 format.


Not sure if these should be there
-no_chain

Do not use certificates in the response as additional untrusted CA certificates.

-no_explicit

Do not explicitly trust the root CA if it is set to be trusted for OCSP signing.
