## System Features

### 1. P7C Format Processing
**Purpose**: Handles PKCS#7 Certificate format CRL files that are commonly used in enterprise environments.

**Implementation**: 
- Enhanced file content analysis to detect DER SEQUENCE, PKCS#7 SignedData, CMS SignedData, and PEM formats
- Multiple extraction methods including PKCS#7 PEM/DER, CMS processing, ASN.1 parsing, and binary analysis
- CRL URL extraction from embedded certificates for downloading actual CRLs

**Expected Results**:
```
[INFO] Detected P7C format CRL
[INFO] Processing P7C format CRL...
[DEBUG] Using enhanced P7C processing v2.1.0
[INFO] File starts with: 308207b406092a864886f70d010702a08207a530
[INFO] File size: 1976 bytes
[INFO] Trying PKCS#7 PEM format...
[INFO] PKCS#7 DER conversion successful
[INFO] Successfully extracted CRL to /tmp/crl_abc123.crl
```

**Success Indicators**:
- ✅ Successful CRL extraction from P7C file
- ✅ Proper parsing of embedded certificates
- ✅ Valid CRL content after extraction

**Failure Indicators**:
- ❌ "CRL parsing failed completely"
- ❌ "Could not process P7C file with any known method"
- ❌ "File may contain CRL data in an unsupported format"

### 2. Response Validity Interval Checks
**Purpose**: Validates OCSP response validity intervals defined by thisUpdate and nextUpdate fields according to RFC 6960.

**Implementation**:
- Validates thisUpdate is present, parseable, and sufficiently recent
- Ensures nextUpdate is present, parseable, and not in the past
- Checks that nextUpdate is after thisUpdate
- Configurable maximum age threshold (default: 24 hours)

**Expected Results**:
```
[VALIDITY] Validating OCSP response validity interval...
[VALIDITY] Current time: 2025-10-18 01:30:00
[VALIDITY] This Update: 2025-10-17 23:59:14
[VALIDITY] ✓ thisUpdate is recent (age: 1.5 hours)
[VALIDITY] Next Update: 2025-10-18 10:59:14
[VALIDITY] ✓ nextUpdate is valid (expires in 9.5 hours)
[VALIDITY] ✓ nextUpdate is after thisUpdate
[VALIDITY] ✓ Response validity interval validation PASSED
[OK] Response Validity Interval: VALID
[INFO] Response age: 1.5 hours
[INFO] Time until expiry: 9.5 hours
```

**Success Indicators**:
- ✅ "Response validity interval validation PASSED"
- ✅ Response age within acceptable limits

### 3. Cryptographic Preference Negotiation
**Purpose**: Implements cryptographic preference negotiation to prevent Man-in-the-Middle downgrade attacks.

**Implementation**:

**Expected Results**:
```
[CRYPTO] Starting cryptographic preference negotiation...
[CRYPTO] Testing algorithm preference 1/9: sha512WithRSAEncryption
[CRYPTO] ✓ Algorithm sha512WithRSAEncryption matched in response: sha512WithRSAEncryption
[CRYPTO] ✓ Algorithm sha512WithRSAEncryption is supported
[CRYPTO] ✓ Strong cryptographic algorithms supported
[CRYPTO] ✓ No cryptographic downgrade attacks detected
[OK] Cryptographic preferences: SECURE
```

**Success Indicators**:

## Error Handling

### Common Error Messages and Solutions

#### P7C Processing Errors
```
[ERROR] CRL parsing failed completely
```
**Solution**: Check if P7C file contains valid CRL data or try alternative CRL URLs

#### Signature Verification Errors
```
[ERROR] Signature verification: FAIL
```
**Solution**: Verify issuer certificate matches OCSP responder, check certificate chain

#### Timestamp Validation Errors
```
[ERROR] Response Validity Interval: INVALID
[WARN] thisUpdate is too old (49.0 hours > 24 hours)
```
**Solution**: Check system clock, verify OCSP server is operational

#### Cryptographic Downgrade Warnings
```
[ERROR] Cryptographic downgrade attack detected
[WARN] Downgrade indicator: Only weak algorithms supported when stronger ones should be available
```
**Solution**: Reject weak algorithms, use strong cryptographic preferences

#### HTTP POST Support Issues
```
[ERROR] HTTP POST support validation FAILED
[WARN] Server supports GET but not POST
```
**Solution**: Use GET for small requests, implement POST support for large requests
